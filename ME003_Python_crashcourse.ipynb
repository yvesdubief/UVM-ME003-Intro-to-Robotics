    "### How to use this notebook:\n",
    "This document is called a Jupyter Notebook. It is the platform used for this course as it enables us to run code and read text all in one interactive document. Its developers describe The Jupyter Notebook as \"... an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\" Jupyter Lab/Notebook is an application that has capability to run 40 different types of code. As you know this class is on Python. The code is stored and compiled on your computer but displayed in your browser. You do not need an internet connection to develop, compile or save code in Jupyter. <br>\n",
